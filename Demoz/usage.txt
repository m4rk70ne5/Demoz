To create a new demo:
   1) Inherit from class tDemo (e.g., class tExampleDemo : public Demo { }; )
   2) Override InitDemo
      - call original with the max and min fps
      - section #1:  load programs
      - section #2:  load geometry
         - map programs to batches via the geoContainer and vaoProgram
           - a batch is just a collection of geometry running under one particular vao
           - geoContainer[vao] = vector of geometry ptrs (for creating geometry, see section below)
           - vaoProgram[vao] = program name
      - load textures to the texture manager
      - section #3:  dynamic objects
           - mode toggler
           - create camera (optional, but most demos will have this)
      - section #4:  initialize/create uniforms
           - any uniform blocks?
           - projection matrix uniform, camera, etc
      - attach camera to input
    3) Override EndDemo to destroy necessary objects (but call original EndDemo)
    4) Create your geometry
      - Can inherit from class tMesh (but doesn't have to)
      - Make sure you override the draw(), update(), and SetUniforms() routine
      - If not inheriting from tMesh, create an Init() routine that initializes buffers and pointers
    5) Add the demo in tDemoList::CreateDemos()

And, of course, create your shaders, placing them in the shader directories created by running create.py 
[name of demo] (under the resources directory).  Put your resources (such as textures) in the resource directory.  
Finally, click Settings... when selecting your demo, and change the directories to point to those places.
